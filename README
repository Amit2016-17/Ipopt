=============================================================================

This package contains the the source code for IPOPT, an interior point
algorithm for large-scale nonlinear optimization (with interfaces to
AMPL and CUTEr).

Homepage: http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt

The files of this package are available from the COIN-OR web page at
http://www.coin-or.org .  They can be obtained via CVS or as tarballs
(see http://www.coin-or.org/download.html).

the IPOPT package see the doc/INSTALL file.  Here, also the
dependencies to third party software components are described.  For
information on compiling under Windows, read the doc/README.Windows
file.  If you just want to quickly build a solver executable for AMPL
or CUTEr, read the doc/QUICKINSTALL file.

More details on IPOPT (including algorithmic parameters and how to
hook up your own program to IPOPT) can be found in doc/README.IPOPT.

As stated in the license, you can use the provided code without
