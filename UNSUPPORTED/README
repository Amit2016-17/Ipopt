The files in this subtree were part of an earlier distribution of IPOPT.  
They implement routines for solving optimal control problems, where the 
differential-algebraic equations are discretized via orthogonal 
collocation on finite elements.

The support of this section has been discontinued, and the Makefile are 
broken.

You may feel free to use those files, which are available under the Common
Public License.
