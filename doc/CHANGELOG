2005-08-19 (no new release)
- corrected detection of BLAS libraries for SUN (make sure the
  example Makefiles work)
- upgrade LICENSE file to CPL version 1.0 as retrieved from
  www.opensource.org

2005-05-30 (release 2.2.1e)

- fixed sign of multipliers returned to AMPL
  (bug reported by Rhoda Baker and Karsten Theissen)
- switched to automake 1.9.5

2005-01-07

- bugfix for the limited memory BFGS in case of square problems
  (bug reported by Wanhe Zhang and Ned Nedialkov)

2004-10-05 (release 2.2.1d)

- Added 'outlev' as an option to the AMPL solver as a synonym for iprint
- For iprint = 0, the output lines per iteration are now suppressed
- corrected two bugs in configure script (test for size of long etc
  before Fortran libraries as added to LIBS; prevent cycling in
  'make -j 1' test)
- internally renamed subroutine ERROR to OPTERROR (ERROR had a
  name clash for some Fortran compiler)
- avoid uninitialized variable in update_b_lm.f
- minor correction in computation of residual in get_step_full.F
- minor change for slack correction in filter.F

2004-07-20 (release 2.2.1c)

- corrected bug leading to very small QTAU in rare circumstances

2004-05-21 (release 2.2.1b)

- Make DFILLINFACT option available through AMPL interface
- Now, later increase of memory requirement for Harwell solvers is also
  based on DFILLINFACT, instead of using a fixed values of 10.

2004-05-13 (release 2.2.1a)

- BUGFIX in IPOPT/ipopt/mainloop.F
  The multipliers were not scaled back for low printlevel.

2004-04-28

- BUGFIX in IPOPT/AMPL_interface/ipoptAMPL.c:
  Now the mulitpliers for the constraints are passed back to AMPL.

- Added download scripts using `wget' to get ASL, BLAS, and LAPACK more
  easily.  Thanks to Frank Wuebbeling for the hint.

2004-04-25   Release of Version 2.2.1.

- AMPL solver executable is now called `ipopt' (instead of `ipoptAMPL')
  This fixed also problem with assigning IPOPT options from within
  AMPL. (reported by Karsten Theissen)

- default value for number of iterations is now 10000 (instead of 1000)

- new option: IMAXCPUSEC to be set to the maximum number of CPU seconds
  after which the algorithm should stop.  The check is performed only at
  certain points in the algorithm, so that the executable might run longer
  than specified.
  The algorithm also stops (as before) when the file "STOP" is detected in
  the current directory.  Finally, a call to `USER_REQUESTED_STOP' has
  been added if the preprocessor macro USE_USER_REQUESTED_STOP has been
  defined. If this LOGICAL function returns .TRUE., the algorithm also
  stops.  This feature was requested by David Ternet.

- if IPOPT is run several time in a row, the counting of function
  evaluations is restarted after every new call of IPOPT.

- in get_step_full, now check if the number of negative eigenvalues is LESS
  than then number constraints.  If so, increase the pivot tolerance,
  and if that doesn't help, pretend that the system is singular.
  (this fixed a problem reported by Hans Mittelmann)

- decrease default values for DPIVTOLMAX

- suppress superflous leading zeros in iteration output.  For long output
  (ioutput=1) include CPU time

- a few changes regarding the inertia correction (get_step_full.F).
  This decreases CPU time significantly in a few cases.

- corrected problem in C-files related to names for struct's (some GNU
  compiler complained)

- changed default options for GNU compilers (now `-O3 -funroll-loops',
  no longer `-O2' and `-mieee-fp')

- no reference to MC35 in resto_tron if HAVE_MC35 is not defined

- '#error' preprocessor directive removed from *.F files, since not all
  compilers understand it (reported by Hans Mittelmann)

- switch to automake 1.8.3


2004-03-10

Release of Version 2.2.0.  Many things have changed since the last
official release.  Here a few highlights:

- easier installation procedure with autoconf
- algorithm made more robust and efficient 
- new restoration phase for filter method (TRON no longer needed for
   full-space option anymore)
- C-interface
